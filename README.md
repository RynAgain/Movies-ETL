# Movies-ETL
 
Perform the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process to create a data pipeline on movie datasets using Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook and PostgreSQL.

This project will create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, from Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata and the MovieLens rating data. It then performs the appropriate transformations and loads the data into an existing PostgreSQL database.
